"""high-poker-2 — HG2Blend: weighted-rank blended bot detector.

Family: high-capacity gradient trio. Three decorrelated members vote by rank
with fixed weights chosen on walk-forward validation:
  * a stacked gradient ensemble on the tree feature view;
  * a monotone-constrained booster restricted to sign-stable features;
  * a neural PCA->MLP on the wide (union) feature view.
Rank voting is calibration-free and robust to member score-scale drift.
Blend weights: (0.35, 0.30, 0.35).
